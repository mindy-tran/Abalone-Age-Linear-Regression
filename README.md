# Abalone Age Linear Regression
Machine Learning project: Construct a linear model which predicts the age of an Abalone.

In this project you will:
1. Implement linear models.
(a) You will write code which reads in data about Abalones from a CSV file.
(b) You will do some pre-processing of the Abalone data.
(c) You will construct a linear model which predicts the age of an Abalone.
The goal of this task is to get you very familiar with SciKit-Learn, a popular library for data
science

*********************************************************************************
Task 0, Set up:

Install the required libraries for this project by running the following commands:
pip install scikit-learn
pip install scipy
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib


*********************************************************************************
Task 1: Run the preprocesssing00.py code

This is a simple python script to convert nominal data into numeric 0 or 1 values based on mutually exclusive categories.
*********************************************************************************

Task 2: Run main.py

This is Linear Regression Code to predict the age of an Abalone and evaluates the model.
This includes the Mean Absolute Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error for the train and test data.
